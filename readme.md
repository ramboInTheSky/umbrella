# umbrella
Welcome to umbrellaðŸŒ²! A project to support webapps and React components as NPM packages

## Developing

### Prerequisites

```npm``` or ```yarn``` are required for this project


### Setup

To build the project run the following steps

To install dependencies for the monorepo, run
```
npm install
```

To install all dependencies for all packages, run
```
npm run bootstrap
```

To build all packages, run
```
npm run build
```

A shortcut for the 2 previous commands is (note this also cleans all generated sources)
```
npm run rebuild
```

### Making Changes

Steps to create a new package

1. add a new package directory to the most fitting directory listed in lerna.json
1. add package.json, gulpfile, tsconfig.json, tslint.json, and src code
1. run ```npm run bootstrap``` (this installs all needed dependencies)
1. run ```npm run dev``` (this launches gulp watch on all src files and runs storybook locally)
